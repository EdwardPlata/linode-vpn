### Step 2: Generate Client Configuration
SSH into your server and create a client profile:
```bash
# SSH into your server (replace with your server IP)
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP

# Generate a client configuration (replace 'my-iphone' with any name)
docker exec openvpn-server /usr/local/bin/generate-client.sh my-iphone

# Download the configuration file
cat /tmp/openvpn-clients/my-iphone.ovpn
```

### Step 3: Import Configuration to Your Apple Device

**For iOS:**
1. Copy the `.ovpn` file content
2. Email it to yourself or use AirDrop
3. Open the email/file on your iPhone/iPad
4. Tap the `.ovpn` file
5. Choose "Open in OpenVPN"
6. Tap the "+" to import
7. Tap "Connect"

**For macOS:**
1. Save the `.ovpn` file to your Mac
2. Double-click the file to open it in OpenVPN Connect
3. Import the profile
4. Click "Connect"

### Step 4: Connect to Your VPN
1. Open the OpenVPN Connect app
2. Toggle the connection switch to connect
3. You're now protected by your personal VPN with ad-blocking!

### Step 5: Verify Ad-Blocking is Working
1. While connected to VPN, visit: http://ads-blocker.com/testing/
2. You should see ads being blocked
3. Check Pi-hole dashboard at http://YOUR_SERVER_IP/admin to see blocked queries

## üñ•Ô∏è Connect from Other Devices

### Windows/Linux/Android
1. Install OpenVPN client for your platform
2. Generate a client configuration (Step 2 above)
3. Import the `.ovpn` file
4. Connect

## Server Management

### Check VPN Status
```bash
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
docker ps                           # Check if container is running
docker logs openvpn-server          # View server logs
```

### Generate Additional Client Configurations
```bash
# Generate config for another device
docker exec openvpn-server /usr/local/bin/generate-client.sh my-laptop
docker exec openvpn-server /usr/local/bin/generate-client.sh my-android

# List all client configurations
ls /tmp/openvpn-clients/
```

### Restart VPN Server
```bash
docker restart openvpn-server
```

## Troubleshooting

### Container Won't Start
```bash
# Check container status
docker ps -a

# View detailed logs
docker logs openvpn-server

# Restart with clean state
docker stop openvpn-server
docker rm openvpn-server
cd /root/docker
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Can't Connect from Apple Device
1. Ensure you're using the **OpenVPN Connect** app (not other OpenVPN apps)
2. Check that your server IP is correct in the `.ovpn` file
3. Verify the server is running: `docker ps`
4. Check firewall: `iptables -L` and `ufw status`

### Performance Issues
- Try different OpenVPN protocols/ports in the server configuration
- Check server resources: `htop` or `docker stats`

## Security Considerations

- Default OpenVPN port: **1194/UDP**
- Pi-hole web interface: **Port 80 (HTTP)** 
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Warning**: HTTP is unencrypted. For production use:
    - Use SSH tunnel: `ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 root@SERVER_IP` then access at `http://localhost:8080/admin`
    - Or set up nginx reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt SSL
    - Or restrict access to trusted IPs via firewall rules
- SSH access: **Port 22** (consider changing in production)
- All VPN traffic is encrypted with **AES-256-CBC**
- TLS authentication provides additional security layer
- Pi-hole blocks malicious domains for added security
- Consider setting up fail2ban for SSH protection
- Use strong Pi-hole admin password (auto-generated during deployment)
- Never expose Pi-hole web interface to public internet without SSL

## Technical Details

- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **VPN Software**: OpenVPN 2.6+
- **Ad-Blocking**: Pi-hole (DNS-based filtering)
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Certificate Authority**: Easy-RSA 3.x
- **VPN Network**: 10.8.0.0/24
- **DNS Server**: Pi-hole (10.8.1.2) with Cloudflare DNS upstream
- **Encryption**: AES-256-CBC with TLS authentication

## Ad-Blocking with Pi-hole

### What is Pi-hole?

Pi-hole is a DNS-based ad-blocker that blocks ads at the network level before they even reach your devices:

- **Blocks Ads Everywhere**: Works on all apps and websites
- **Blocks Trackers**: Prevents tracking across the web
- **Faster Browsing**: Pages load faster without ads
- **Saves Bandwidth**: Reduces data usage
- **Privacy Protection**: Prevents data collection

### How It Works

1. Your device connects to the VPN
2. All DNS queries go through Pi-hole
3. Pi-hole checks domain against blocklists
4. Ads and trackers are blocked, legitimate traffic passes through
5. You browse the web ad-free!

### Managing Pi-hole

Access the Pi-hole web interface:
```
http://YOUR_SERVER_IP/admin
```

Use the password generated during deployment (found in the deployment output).

**Pi-hole Dashboard Features:**
- View real-time query statistics
- Add custom blocklists
- Whitelist/blacklist specific domains
- See top blocked domains
- Monitor query logs

### Default Blocklists

Pi-hole comes pre-configured with popular blocklists that block:
- Advertising domains
- Tracking and analytics
- Malware and phishing sites
- Cryptomining scripts

You can add more blocklists through the web interface under Settings ‚Üí Blocklists.

## Cost Estimation

- **Linode Nanode 1GB**: ~$5/month
- **Bandwidth**: 1TB included (plenty for personal VPN use)
- **Total**: ~$5/month for unlimited personal VPN access
