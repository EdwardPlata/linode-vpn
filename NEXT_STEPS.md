## üöÄ Your Next Steps

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Secrets (CRITICAL)

Go to your repository: **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions**

Add these 6 secrets:

| Secret Name | What to Put | Where to Get It |

| `MAIL_TO` | Where to send VPN details | Your email (can be same as MAIL_USERNAME) |

**Important:** 
- `MAIL_PASSWORD` must be a Gmail **App Password** (16 chars), NOT your regular Gmail password
- You need 2-Step Verification enabled to generate App Passwords
